# SparkPost email extension for CiviCRM

This is a Coop SymbioTIC fork of the excellent SparkPost extension by CiviDesk:  
https://github.com/cividesk/com.cividesk.email.sparkpost

This is a slightly experimental fork to simplify our setup process and improve
performance. For example, since SparkPost sends all events to all
webhooks (for all subaccounts), we use [SparkPostRouter](https://github.com/coopsymbiotic/coop.symbiotic.sparkpostrouter).

We strongly encourage you to use the official CiviDesk extension rather than this one,
unless you are hosted by [Coop SymbioTIC](https://www.symbiotic.coop/en), of course! ;-)

Some of the additional features included in this fork:

* Uses the SparkPost PHP library (and Guzzle), instead of Curl
* Track transactional email bounces (by Veda Consulting: https://github.com/cividesk/com.cividesk.email.sparkpost/pull/22)

# Original README by CiviDesk

This extension allows CiviCRM to send emails and process bounces through the SparkPost service.

It was designed to seamlessly integrate in the CiviCRM UI, be fully documented and well maintained, be trivial to install and configure, be nimble and fast and accurately process bounces.
It currently is one of the [Top 10](https://stats.civicrm.org/?tab=sites) most used extensions for CiviCRM.

Full documentation (including installation instructions) can be found at https://docs.civicrm.org/sparkpost.

## Show your support!

Development of this extension was fully self-funded by Cividesk and equated to about 40 hours of work.

You can show your support and appreciation for our work by making a donation at https://www.cividesk.com/pay and indicating 'SparkPost support' as the invoice id.

Suggested donation amounts are _$40 for end-users_, and _$40 per client_ using this extension for service providers. With these suggested amounts, we would need 120 donations just to recoup our development costs. Needless to say we are far from that at the moment!

These donations will fund maintenance and updates for this extension, as well as production of other extensions in the future.

Thanks!
